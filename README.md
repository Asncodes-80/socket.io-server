# Socket.io Server Express App

Ready to run in your local machine. Use `http://localhost:8080/checkout` to
connect your Socket.io client application.

Install nodemon to running node.js/express app in hot-reload mode:

```sh
    npm install -g nodemon
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add `JWT` verification support
- [ ] Support client Headers and Queries


## Supported

- Angular: ^any
- React: ^17..latest
- Vue: ^latest

## Setup may have problem

So you should have `NVM` to switch to different NodeJS version.

```sh
    nvm install 14.17.3
    nvm use 14.17.3
```

## In production

It's not perfect to use in production mode. It's only made for quick check
Clients Socket.io connection to server.

Everyone can have PR to improve this Socket.io Server.
